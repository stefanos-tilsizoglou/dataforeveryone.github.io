            Fontana di Trevi
            <p class= "contents"><em>The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi)</em> <strong>is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy,</strong> designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini and several others. It is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and considered one of the most famous fountains in the world. Coins are purportedly meant to be thrown using the right hand over the left shoulder.</p>

            Pantheon
            <p class= "contents"><em>The Pantheon</em> <strong>is a former Roman temple, now a church, in Rome, Italy,</strong> on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus (27 BC â€“ 14 AD). It was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated about 126 AD. Its date of construction is uncertain, because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa's older temple, which had burned down.</p>

            Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II
            <p class= "contents"><em>Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II</em> <strong>is a bridge in Rome</strong> constructed to designs of 1886 by the architect Ennio De Rossi. Construction was delayed, and it was not inaugurated until 1911. The bridge across the Tiber connects the historic centre of Rome (Corso Vittorio Emanuele, whose axis the bridge extends, and piazza Paoli at the bridgehead) with the rione Borgo and the Vatican City, close what is left of the ancient Pons Neronianus. The bridge commemorating Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy is carried in three arches spanning a distance of 108 metres. It is decorated at the ends with high socles carrying colossal bronze winged Victories and over each of the piers with massive allegorical travertine sculptural groups.
